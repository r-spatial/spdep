\usage{
local_joincount_uni(
  fx,
  chosen,
  listw,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  nsim = 199,
  iseed = NULL,
  no_repeat_in_row=FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fx}{a factor with two levels; use of an ordered factor is not well understood.}

\item{chosen}{a scalar character containing the level of \code{fx} that should be considered the observed value (1).}

\item{listw}{a listw object containing binary weights created, for example, with \code{nbwlistw(nb, style = "B")}}

\item{alternative}{default \code{"greater"}. One of \code{"less"} or \code{"greater"}.}

\item{nsim}{the number of conditional permutation simulations}

\item{iseed}{default NULL, used to set the seed; the output will only be reproducible if the count of CPU cores across which computation is distributed is the same}

\item{no_repeat_in_row}{default \code{FALSE}, if \code{TRUE}, sample conditionally in each row without replacements to avoid duplicate values, \url{https://github.com/r-spatial/spdep/issues/124}}

}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} with two columns \code{BB} and \code{Pr()} and number of rows equal to the length of \code{x}.
}
\description{
The univariate local join count statistic is used to identify clusters of rarely occurring binary variables. The binary variable of interest should occur less
than half of the time.
}
\details{
The local join count statistic requires a binary weights list which can be generated with \code{nb2listw(nb, style = "B")}. Additionally, ensure that the binary variable of interest is rarely occurring in no more than half of observations.

P-values are estimated using a conditional permutation approach. This creates a reference distribution from which the observed statistic is compared. For more see \href{https://geodacenter.github.io/glossary.html#ppvalue}{Geoda Glossary}.

data(oldcol)
fx <- as.factor(ifelse(COL.OLD$CRIME < 35, "low-crime", "high-crime"))
listw <- nb2listw(COL.nb, style = "B")
set.seed(1)
(res <- local_joincount_uni(fx, chosen = "high-crime", listw))
